# Route Navigator - Private Routes & User Authentication

## Description
Route Navigator is a React-based web application designed to showcase the implementation of routing, private routes, and user authentication. The application features multiple routes, some of which are accessible only to authenticated users, providing a practical insight into securing certain parts of a React application.

## Learning Objectives
- **React Routing**: Gain a deeper understanding of how routing works in React applications.
- **Private Routes**: Learn to create routes that are accessible only to authenticated users.
- **User Authentication**: Implement a basic user authentication system.
- **Protected Navigation**: Understand the process of protecting certain routes based on user authentication status.

## Features
- **Multiple Routes**: Experience navigating between different routes in a React application.
- **Authentication System**: Simulated user authentication to demonstrate protected routes.
- **Private Routes**: Routes that require user authentication to access.
- **Public Routes**: Unrestricted routes accessible to all users.
- **Dynamic Navigation**: Depending on authentication status, the navigation experience changes.

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/UniversityOfEmergingTechnology/studynotion-app.git
cd route-navigator
npm install
npm start
```

## Usage
Navigate through the app to explore different routes. Attempt accessing private routes before and after authentication to see how the application responds.
